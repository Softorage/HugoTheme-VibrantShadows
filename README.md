## Prerequisites

Firstly, *ensure you have installed the latest (min v0.75.1) [extended version of Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)*. You may need to scroll down a bit to see extended versions. Alternatively, you may see installation steps from [Hugo's official docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

If you don't have or can't have extended version of Hugo installed, copy the resources folder from theme to root of your Hugo website directory. Hugo autodetects required files, and uses them. Note that it might make your website slightly slow to load.

## Getting up and running

Read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) above and verify you're using the extended version of Hugo. There are at least two ways of quickly getting started with Hugo and the Vibrant Shadows theme:

### Setting up new Hugo website

```bash
hugo new site yourSiteName # generate a new Hugo site if you don't already have one
cd yourSiteName # move in to the Hugo website's directory
```

#### 1. As a Hugo theme (recommended)

1. Download the repo on your machine
2. Extract the zip file and rename the folder from `HugoTheme-VibrantShadows-master` to `HugoTheme-VibrantShadows`.
3. Copy this folder and paste it into you Hugo Website directory.
4. Simply add the repo to your theme option in `config.yaml`:
    
    ```yaml
    theme: "HugoTheme-VibrantShadows"
    ```

#### 2. As Git Submodule

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```bash
git init # to initiate git if it isn't already
git submodule add https://github.com/Softorage/HugoTheme-VibrantShadows.git themes/HugoTheme-VibrantShadows # add theme as a git submodule
cp -a themes/HugoTheme-VibrantShadows/exampleSite/* . # start with the boilerplate by copying it into current directory
```

Then run

```bash
hugo server
```

And, we're done!

If you have extended version of Hugo installed, copy the `postcss.config.js` file to the root of your Hugo Website directory after setting up the theme. We also recommend creating a `package.json` file in your Hugo Website directory.

### Using boilerplate provided

1. Copy exampleSite folder provided, and move into this folder (open this folder).
2. Then run `hugo server` in terminal.

And, we're done!

Once set, jump over to the `config.yaml` file and start [configuring](#configuration) your site.

## Configuration

Here, we will mainly see settings that are unique to this theme. If something is not covered here (or elsewhere in this file), there's a good chance it is covered in [this Hugo docs page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-file). At the end of this section you will find an example `config.yaml` file, with all the options. It may serve in understanding all the options a bit better.

### Global Parameters

These options set global values that some pages or all pages in the site use by default.

#### Hugo's built-in parameters

1.  **BaseURL** *(Type: String | Accepts value: URL | Required | No default)*
    
    baseURL is the URL of the website or blog.

3.  **Author** *(Type: String | Accepts value: Text | Required | No default)*
    
    We won't be using `site.Authors` till this parameter is finalised. See [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3088).

    ```

4.  **Copyright** *(Type: String | Accepts value: Text | Optional | No default)*

    It is your Google Analytics ID, if any. Respecting your preference from 'privacy', and 'params -> user_experience' configuration, if you set this value, Google Analytics code will be included. Google Analytics included only when serving the website on 'production' environment (i.e. website built with `hugo` command and not `hugo serve`)
    
    Example:

    googleAnalytics: "UA-123456789-0"
    ```
8.  **Disqus Shortname** *(Type: String | Accepts value: Alphanumeric | Optional | No default)*
    
    It is your Disqus Shortname, if any. Respecting your preference from 'privacy', if you set this value, Disqus comments code will be included at the end of the blog posts.

9.  **Taxonomies** *(Type: Map/Dict/Object | Accepts value: - | Optional | Default: Tags & Categories)*
    
    This feature allows to define custom taxonomies for post/page management.
    
    Example:

    taxonomies:
      tag: "tags" # when defining custom taxonomies, we need to redefine even the default taxonomies if we wish to keep them, hence we have redefined 'tags'. see here: https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies#example-adding-a-custom-taxonomy-named-series
      category: "categories" # redefined 'categories'
      series: "series" # defined a custom taxonomy, 'series'
    ```
10. **Menus** *(Type: Map/Dict/Object | Accepts value: - | Optional | No default)*
    
    These are the menus that are used by users to navigate the website/blog. An example would be 'main' menu, which usually resides on navbar.
    
    Example:
    ```yaml
    menu:
      main:
        - identifier: "about" # different for all menu entries, useful especially when menu name coincides
          name: "About" # shown on website/blog
          url: "/about/" # user is taken to this url when user clicks on menu item
          weight: 10 # used to sort menu items by weight
        - identifier: "sub-about"
          name: "Sub About"

    ```
12. **Privacy** *(Type: Map/Dict/Object | Accepts value: - | Optional)*
    
    This feature allows to maintain optimal privacy settings for the website/blog. You can see full list of privacy settings [here](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#all-privacy-settings), and their explanation [here](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#the-privacy-settings-explained).
    
    Example:
    ```yaml
    privacy:
      disqus:
        disable: "false" # | default: false
      googleAnalytics:
        anonymizeIP: "true" # 'true' makes it so the users' IP addresses are anonymized within Google Analytics | default: false
        disable: "false" # | default: false
        respectDoNotTrack: "false" # 'true' makes the GA templates respect the “Do Not Track” HTTP header | default: false

    ```
